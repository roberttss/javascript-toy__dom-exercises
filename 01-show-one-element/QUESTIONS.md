pazudis poga jo ja restarte lapu tad skripts ari restartejas 

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

ne vairs nestrada poga jo neredzes klases.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)
